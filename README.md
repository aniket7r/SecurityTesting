This document outlines the findings from the Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) performed on the testphp.vulnweb project. The assessment aimed to uncover potential security flaws within the application. As this marks my first VAPT on a web application, the number of identified vulnerabilities is relatively limited.

Disclaimer:
This report reflects a snapshot of the application's security posture at the time of testing; new vulnerabilities may surface as the application evolves.

Note:
Vulnerabilities are organized according to their severity levels.
